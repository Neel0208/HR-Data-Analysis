# HR-Data-Analysis
Power bi

# [Overview]

This project focuses on analyzing HR data to gain insights into employee attrition, job satisfaction, and workforce demographics using Power BI. It includes a variety of visualizations and key metrics that help in understanding trends, performance, and factors influencing employee retention. The analysis uses Power Query for data cleaning and transformation, and visualizes the data using charts, cards in Power BI.

# [Project Description]

This HR data analysis project provides valuable insights into employee attrition and various workforce metrics, helping HR managers and business leaders to:

Understand the attrition trends based on various employee demographics (e.g., department, gender, age, education).

Analyze the job satisfaction levels among employees.

Monitor key workforce statistics like active employees, average age, and attrition rates.

# [The analysis includes interactive charts and metrics to track the following]:

Attrition rate by department and employee group.

Job satisfaction ratings across different departments.

Attrition rate by gender and age groups.

Attrition by education field and its correlation with employee retention.

Key metrics shown in cards such as average age, attrition rate, and active employees.

# [Technologies Used]

Power BI Desktop: Tool used for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

Power Query: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for creating calculated fields and measures.

# [Data Cleaning Process]

Data cleaning in this project was done using Power Query to ensure the dataset was in a usable format and free of inconsistencies:

Removing Missing Values: All null or missing values were identified and handled (either by imputation or removal).

Data Type Conversion: Ensured that all columns had the correct data types (e.g., dates were converted to date type, numerical columns were appropriately formatted).

Column Splitting: Some columns were split to extract useful information (e.g., separating full names into first and last names).

Handling Duplicates: Duplicate rows were removed to avoid skewing the analysis.

Filtering Outliers: Outliers were identified and treated to prevent them from distorting the analysis.

Calculated Columns: Created calculated fields like attrition rate, average age, etc., directly in Power Query or using DAX.


# [Key Visualizations]

The Power BI report includes several visualizations to track key HR metrics:

[Department-Wise Attrition]:

A bar chart showing the attrition rate by department.

Provides insights into which departments experience the highest employee turnover.


[Number of Employees by Group]:

A pie chart or bar chart that breaks down the total number of employees by groups (e.g., job role, employment status).

Helps to identify how the workforce is distributed across different groups.


[Job Satisfaction Ratings]:

A bar chart or column chart to analyze job satisfaction ratings across departments.

Shows whether job satisfaction correlates with retention and helps identify areas of improvement.


[Attrition Rate by Gender & Age Group]:

Stacked bar charts or line charts comparing the attrition rate by gender across different age groups.

Helps to identify whether certain age groups or genders are more prone to leaving the company.


[Sum of Attrition Count by Education Field]:

A bar chart displaying the sum of attrition counts based on the education field.

This chart helps to understand if employees with certain educational backgrounds are more likely to leave the company.


[Key Metrics (Cards)]:

Average Age: Displays the average age of employees in the workforce.

Attrition Rate: Shows the overall attrition rate, calculated dynamically


Active Employees: Displays the total number of active employees, excluding those who have left the organization.

Total Attrition: Displays the total number of employees who have left the company within a specific time frame.

These key metrics are shown as cards, offering a quick snapshot of the most important workforce statistics.
